# Jets Job Runner

```
Hi All! Really loving the jets framework. Need one small tweak to get my application to work perfectly.
In my AWS console I need to manually adjust my "application-policy" IAM policy.
I need to add Lamda access so it can queue up jobs
Let me take a quick screenshot of the change
IAM Management Console 2020-12-03 14-59-06.png
I had to add Lamba access to the application to queue up jobs
Which makes sense.
Looks like I need to add some form of a policy_definition based on the source code
https://github.com/boltops-tools/jets/blob/master/lib/jets/resource/iam/application_role.rb#L6
Just looked into the config/application.rb file that was autogenerated
didn't really seem helpful.

Any advice about how to change this?
